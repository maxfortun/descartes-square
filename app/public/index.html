	<meta name="description" content="A Descartes' Square is a decision making technique, invention of which is attributed to RenÃ© Descartes, a French philosopher, scientist, and mathematician, widely considered a seminal figure in the emergence of modern philosophy and science. It is an enhanced approach to its more familiar relative Pros/Cons list. Instead of creating two lists of advantages and disadvantages of a decision, a two by two grid is created and each resulting quadrant is populated accordingly. A completed Descartes` Square provides a deeper insight into the consequences of a decision. This tools aims to take the Descartes` Square technique further, by allowing sharing and collaborating on a decision across multiple contributors. It just may be the best decision you'll ever make.">
